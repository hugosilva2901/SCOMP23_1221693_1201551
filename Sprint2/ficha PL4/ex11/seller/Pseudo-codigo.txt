synchronization pattern: synchronization of execution
(2 semaphore; all initialized at 1)

 Define constants for semaphore and shared memory names and number of children
 Define a Ticket structure with a ticketNumber field
 In the main function:
     Open two semaphores with initial value 0
     Check if semaphores opened successfully, exit with error if not
     Create and open a shared memory object
     Check if shared memory object opened successfully, exit with error if not
     Map the shared memory object to an integer pointer
     Check if mapping was successful, exit with error if not
     Set the ticket value to 0
     Loop NR_CHILDREN times:
         Increment the ticket value
         Print the ticket value
         Post on the wait_for_ticket semaphore
         Wait on the ticket_to_customer semaphore
     Close both semaphores and check for errors
     Return 0
