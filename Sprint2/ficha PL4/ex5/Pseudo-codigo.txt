Create three semaphores called sem_child1, sem_child2, and sem_child3 with initial values of 0
Create three child processes using fork()
If the current process is the first child process:
    Print "Sistemas"
    Post to sem_child2
    Wait on sem_child1
    Print "a"
    Post to sem_child2
    Exit the child process
If the current process is the second child process:
    Wait on sem_child2
    Print "de"
    Post to sem_child3
    Wait on sem_child2
    Print "melhor"
    Post to sem_child3
    Exit the child process
If the current process is the third child process:
    Wait on sem_child3
    Print "Computadores-"
    Post to sem_child1
    Wait on sem_child3
    Print "disciplina!"
    Post to sem_child1
    Exit the child process
If the current process is the parent process:
    Wait for all child processes to finish
    Unlink and close all three semaphores
