synchronization pattern: synchronization of execution
(semaphore; a initialized at 10)

Define MAX_CAPACITY as 10
Open a named semaphore "/club_sem" with an initial value of MAX_CAPACITY
For i = 0 to MAX_CAPACITY*2:
    Create a child process using fork
    If the process is a child process:
        Wait on the semaphore
        Print "Client entered."
        Sleep for 5 seconds
        Print "Client left."
       Post to the semaphore
       Exit the child process
For i = 0 to MAX_CAPACITY*2:
    Wait for a child process to finish
Close the semaphore
Unlink the named semaphore
Return 0
