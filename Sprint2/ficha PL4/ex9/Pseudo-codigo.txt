synchronization pattern: synchronization of execution
(semaphore; a initialized at 0)

Parse command-line arguments to get the number of child processes (n) and the execution time for each child process (time)
Start measuring the execution time of the program
Create n child processes using a loop
For each child process:
    Wait for a signal to start executing
    Execute for the specified amount of time (time)
    Signal that execution is finished
Signal all child processes to start executing
Wait for all child processes to finish executing
Stop measuring the execution time of the program
Print the total execution time of the program
