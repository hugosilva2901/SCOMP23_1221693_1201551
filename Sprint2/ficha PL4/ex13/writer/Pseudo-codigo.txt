synchronization pattern: synchronization of execution
(semaphore; a initialized at 1)

Define constants for maximum number of writers and shared memory key
Define a structure for shared memory with a string and integers for the number of readers and writers
Declare shared memory and semaphore pointers
Define a signal handler function that takes an integer signal as an argument
In the signal handler function:
    Close the mutex semaphore
    Unlink the mutex semaphore with name "/mutex"
    Close the write mutex semaphore
    Unlink the write mutex semaphore with name "/write_mutex"
    Exit with status 0
Define a writer function that takes an integer id as an argument
In the writer function:
    Wait on the write mutex semaphore
    Wait on the mutex semaphore
    Get the current time
    Write the id, process id, and current time to the string in shared memory using sprintf
    Increment the number of writers in shared memory
    Print the id, number of writers, and number of readers from shared memory
    Post to the mutex semaphore
    Post to the write mutex semaphore
In the main function:
    Register signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals using signal_handler function
    Open a shared memory object with name “/shared_mem” and size of the shared memory structure using shm_open.
    If shm_open returns -1, print an error message and exit with status 1.
    Map the shared memory object into the process’s address space using mmap.
    If mmap returns MAP_FAILED, print an error message and exit with status 1.
    Open a semaphore with name “/mutex” and initial value 1 using sem_open.
    If sem_open returns SEM_FAILED, print an error message and exit with status 1.
    Set readers and writers in shared memory to 0.
    Loop MAX_WRITERS times:
        Fork a new process
        In the child process, call writer function with loop index as argument and exit with status 0
        If fork returns -1, print an error message and exit with status 1 
    Loop MAX_WRITERS times:
        Wait for a child process to exit 
        If wait returns -1, print an error message and exit with status 1 
Return 0 from main function.
