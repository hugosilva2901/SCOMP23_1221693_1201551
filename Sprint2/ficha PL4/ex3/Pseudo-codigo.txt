Open shared memory object

Initialize shared memory object
Open semaphore
While the number of lines written in the shared memory is less than MAX_FRASES:
    Wait at most 12 seconds to acquire the semaphore
    If the deadline is missed, warn the user and continue to the next iteration
    Find the first free string in the shared memory
    If there are no free strings, break the loop
    Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    If the random number is less than or equal to 30 and there is at least one line written in the shared memory:
        Remove the last written string from the shared memory
        Decrement the number of lines written in the shared memory
        Print a message indicating that the last line was removed
    Else:
        Write a new line to the shared memory with the text "I'm the Father - with PID X", where X is the PID of the process
        Increment the number of lines written in the shared memory
        Print a message indicating that a new line was written
    Release the semaphore
    Sleep for a random time between 1 and 5 seconds
Close semaphore
Unmap shared memory object
Close shared memory object
