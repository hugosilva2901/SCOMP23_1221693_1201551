Define constants N_CHILDREN and MAX
Initialize an array of integers called num with size MAX
Create a semaphore called sem_numbers with an initial value of 1
Create a semaphore called sem_out with an initial value of 1
Open a file called "Output.txt" for writing
For i = 0 to N_CHILDREN - 1:
    Create a child process using fork()
    If the current process is a child process:
        Close the file descriptor for "Output.txt"
        Open a file called "Numbers.txt" for reading
        Initialize an integer variable j to 0
        While there are numbers to read from "Numbers.txt" and j < MAX:
            Wait on the semaphore sem_numbers
            Read a number from "Numbers.txt" and store it in num[j]
            Increment j
            Signal the semaphore sem_numbers
        Close the file "Numbers.txt"
        Wait on the semaphore sem_out
        Open the file "Output.txt" for appending
        For k = 0 to j - 1:
            Write the process ID and num[k] to "Output.txt"
        Close the file "Output.txt"
        Signal the semaphore sem_out
        Exit the child process
Wait for all child processes to finish
Get the size of the file "Output.txt"
Map the contents of "Output.txt" into memory
Print the contents of the mapped memory
Unlink the semaphore sem_numbers
Unlink the semaphore sem_out
Close the file "Output.txt"
