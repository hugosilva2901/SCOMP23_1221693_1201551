Define constants NR_CHILDREN and MAX
Initialize an array of integers called num with size MAX
Create a semaphore called sem with an initial value of 1
Open a file called "Output.txt" for writing
For i = 0 to NR_CHILDREN - 1:
    Create a child process using fork()
    If the current process is a child process:
        Close the file descriptor for "Output.txt"
        Open a file called "Numbers.txt" for reading
        Initialize an integer variable j to 0
        While there are numbers to read from "Numbers.txt" and j < MAX:
        Wait on the semaphore sem
        Read a number from "Numbers.txt" and store it in num[j]
        Increment j
        ignal the semaphore sem
        Close the file "Numbers.txt"
    Open the file "Output.txt" for appending
    For k = 0 to j - 1:
        Write the process ID and num[k] to "Output.txt"
    Close the file "Output.txt"
    Exit the child process
Wait for all child processes to finish
Get the size of the file "Output.txt"
Map the contents of "Output.txt" into memory
Print the contents of the mapped memory
Unlink the semaphore sem
Close the file "Output.txt"
